p(align="justify") Most browsers ignore the width property here because they donâ€™t support CSS expressions and instead use the min-width property.Internet Explorer ignores the min-width property and instead sets the width property dynamically based on the width of the document.CSS expressions are re-evaluated when the page changes, such as when it is resized.This ensures that as the user resizes his browser, the width is adjusted appropriately.The frequency with which CSS expressions are evaluated is what makes them work, but it is also what makes CSS expressions bad for performance.
