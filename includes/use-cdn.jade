p(align="justify") The average user’s bandwidth increases every year, but a user’s proximity to your web server still has an impact on a page’s response time.Web startups often have all their servers in one location.If they survive the startup phase and build a larger audience, these companies face the reality that a single server location is no longer sufficient— it’s necessary to deploy content across multiple, geographically dispersed servers.
