p(align="justify") This script is programmed to take 10 seconds to load, so it’s easy to see the problem— the bottom half of the page takes about 10 seconds to appear (see the section “sleep.cgi” in Chapter 5 for an explanation of how components are configured to have specific load times).This occurs because the script blocks parallel downloading. We’ll come back to this problem after a review of how browsers download in parallel.

p(align="justify") The other problem with the example page has to do with progressive rendering. When using stylesheets, progressive rendering is blocked until all stylesheets have been downloaded.That’s why it’s best to move stylesheets to the document HEAD, so they are downloaded first and rendering isn’t blocked.With scripts, progressive rendering is blocked for all content below the script.Moving scripts lower in the page means more content is rendered progressively.
